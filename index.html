        <p><b> Wishing you a very happiest teacher;s day <u>Buaa Ji</u>
            Well, you're also a teacher, a mentor who guides us and provides the 
            right path to wanderer like us. Undoubtedly, Shivbaba is our greatest mentor,
            but Shivshaktis like you, Kirti didi, Laxmi didi and more have been entrusted
            with the task of instructing people and tirelessly performing Shivbaba's work.
            I can't even match 1% of you, that's why we are students and you are experiences teacher.
            Whenever we all get hopeless, we come to you,
            you listen to us without judging us and provide the best solution.
            Thank you for motivating, uplifting, guiding and caring for useless "Me".
